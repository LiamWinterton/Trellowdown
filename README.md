# ES6 - Boilerplate

I'm not sure how this works cross platform, but this works for me on my windows dev machine at work. Fairly new to webpack and npm so don't expect a lot in terms of updates. It works for me and that is it's only intended use currently.

## Commands

* npm run build - Runs the webpack dev server
* npm run build - Runs webpack for production.

## Wishlist / To Do

* Nicer looking basic template, maybe some bootstrap.
